The Orpheus System transforms static slides into interactive lecture videos with lifelike professor avatars, combining expressive narration, visual presence, and dynamic content to create engaging, personalized learning experiences

## Architecture Overview
<!---
The diagram was created with [Apollon](https://apollon.ase.in.tum.de/).
You can edit it by adjusting [OrpheusArchitecture.apollon](./OrpheusArchitecture.apollon).
We recommend using [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Apollon Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TUMAET.apollon-vscode) to do so.

Once you edited the diagram, make sure to export it as svg to replace the existing [OrpheusArchitecture.svg](./OrpheusArchitecture.svg).
